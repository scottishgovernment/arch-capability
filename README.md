# Architecture Capability

The architecture capability is focused on the arrangements that should be in place in order to allow the operation of a mature architecture practice. This will typically include:

- organisational structure;
- processes and governance;
- products and services offered;
- roles and responsibilities;
- skills and knowledge;
- professional development and certification;
- enterprise continuum and architecture repository;
- Modelling languages, tooling and other infrastructure.

The material in this repository is authored for use by the Scottish Government's DPS&BT division but is based on general best practice and will likely be useful in other contexts too.
